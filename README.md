## Learning objectives :woman_technologist:

After learning how to write PHP code, Object-Oriented Programming, the MVC pattern for code organization, and how to connect a database to your PHP application, it's now time to see for yourself how a framework can take most of the boring work off your hands.
At the end of this 5-day challenge you will:

- be able to create a new React application
- be able to "think in React"
- be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
- be able to organize your app in components

This is the repository for the exercise: https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-yu-3-21/tree/master/3.The-Mountain/8.React


## The Mission

This time the task is simple: you will build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after browsers restart.

## Tips & Deliverables :teacher:

- Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
- Deploy the project on Netlify
- Tip: to deploy a React app you first run the command npm run build, and once the command finishes you will have your app ready in the build folder: just drag and drop this folder in Netlify and you are done. Easy!
